# ✅ Task Management System

Hi! I’m **Layan Samhan**, and this is another personal C project I built to practice working with user input, arrays, and logic flow: a **console-based Task Management System**. It's simple, fast, and designed to help users manage their to-do tasks directly from the terminal.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

This program lets users manage tasks from the command line. It supports:

* Adding new tasks
* Viewing all tasks
* Marking tasks as completed
* Deleting tasks
* Editing existing tasks
* Saving and loading tasks from a file (optional)

It’s fully text-based and designed to be minimal but functional.

## 🧪 Features

* 📋 Add a task with a name and optional description
* 👀 View all tasks with their status (Pending / Done)
* ✅ Mark tasks as completed
* ❌ Delete tasks by number
* 📝 Edit task name or description
* 💾 Save/load tasks to/from a text file

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc -o task_manager main.c
   ```

2. Run it:

   ```bash
   ./task_manager
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system.

## 🧱 Core Concepts Used

* Arrays and strings
* User-defined functions
* File I/O (optional)
* Input validation
* Loops and conditionals
* Menu-driven interface

## 📌 Example Menu

```

1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Mark Task as Done
4. Edit Task
5. Delete Task
6. Exit
Enter your choice:
```

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to simulate a basic productivity app using pure C. It helped me practice how to structure menu-based programs, work with strings, and build user-friendly console interactions.
